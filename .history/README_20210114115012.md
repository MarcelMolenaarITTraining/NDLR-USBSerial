# NDLR-USBSerial
Serial communication over USB to the NDLR using PowerShell

For those NDLR-ers who want to play around with the NDLR Librarian and talk to the NDLR without having to install the [Cool Term](https://github.com/Barilium8/The-NDLR-Librarian/wiki/0)-The-NDLR-USB-Serial-Interface-Intro)serial terminal program, I created this PowerShell script.
