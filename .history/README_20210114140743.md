# NDLR-USBSerial
## Serial communication over USB to the NDLR with PowerShell

For those NDLR-ers who want to play around with the [NDLR Librarian](https://github.com/Barilium8/The-NDLR-Librarian) and talk to the NDLR over USB without having to install the [Cool Term](https://github.com/Barilium8/The-NDLR-Librarian/wiki/0) serial terminal program, I have created this PowerShell script to get started. It isn't finished but it shows that you don't need install any program to communicate with your [NDLR](https://conductivelabs.com/). 

On a Windows 10 machine, PowerShell and a Windows USB to Serial driver is already installed. The USB Serial driver is [installed automatically](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/usbcon/usb-driver-installation-based-on-compatible-ids).

## PowerShell 
[Writing and Reading info from Serial Ports](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/powershell/writing-and-reading-info-from-serial-ports/) with PowerShell is quite easy. After connecting the NDLR, you need to open the COM port, send a command to the NDLR and read the response.

As far as I know, there is no special Serial Port module to install. However you can use the .Net SerialPost Class and call it directly from PowerShell.

| Class/Enum/Method | Description |
| - | - |
| [SerialPort Class](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.io.ports.serialport) | Represents a serial port resource |
| [Parity Enum](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.io.ports.parity?view=dotnet-plat-ext-5.0) | Specifies the parity bit for a SerialPort object |
| [StopBits Enum]() | Specifies the number of stop bits used on the SerialPort object |
| [StopBits Enum]() | Specifies the number of stop bits used on the SerialPort object |
| [StopBits Enum]() | Specifies the number of stop bits used on the SerialPort object |

> **Note**: The System.IO.Ports.SerialPort class is also available in [.Net Core](https://www.nuget.org/packages/System.IO.Ports/) so you can also try to run this script on Linux or a Mac.

## Available COM port
Before connecting, you need to retrieve the available COM port. You can use this PowerShell command:
```
[System.IO.Ports.SerialPort]::getportnames()
```
On my machine it returns COM 5:
