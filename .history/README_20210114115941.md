# NDLR-USBSerial
## Serial communication over USB to the NDLR with PowerShell

For those NDLR-ers who want to play around with the [NDLR Librarian](https://github.com/Barilium8/The-NDLR-Librarian) and talk to the NDLR over USB without having to install the [Cool Term](https://github.com/Barilium8/The-NDLR-Librarian/wiki/0) serial terminal program, I have created this PowerShell script to get started. It isn't finished but it shows that you don't need install any program to communicate with your [NDLR](https://conductivelabs.com/). 

On a Windows 10 machine, PowerShell and a Windows USB to Serial driver is already installed. The USB Serial driver is [installed automatically](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/usbcon/usb-driver-installation-based-on-compatible-ids).

## PowerShell 
[Writing and Reading info from Serial Ports](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/powershell/writing-and-reading-info-from-serial-ports/) with PowerShell is quite easy.
