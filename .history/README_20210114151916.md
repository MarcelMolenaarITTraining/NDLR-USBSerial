# NDLR-USBSerial
## Serial communication over USB to the NDLR with PowerShell

For those NDLR-ers who want to play around with the [NDLR Librarian](https://github.com/Barilium8/The-NDLR-Librarian) and talk to the NDLR over USB without having to install the [Cool Term](https://github.com/Barilium8/The-NDLR-Librarian/wiki/0) serial terminal program, I have created this [PowerShell script](NDLRUSBSerial.ps1) to get started. It isn't finished but it shows that you don't need install any program to communicate with your [NDLR](https://conductivelabs.com/). 

On a Windows 10 machine, PowerShell and a Windows USB to Serial driver is already installed. The USB Serial driver is [installed automatically](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/usbcon/usb-driver-installation-based-on-compatible-ids).

## PowerShell 
[Writing and Reading info from Serial Ports](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/powershell/writing-and-reading-info-from-serial-ports/) with PowerShell is quite easy. After connecting the NDLR, you need to open the COM port, send a command to the NDLR and read the response.

As far as I know, there is no special Serial Port module to install. However you can use the .Net SerialPost Class and call it directly from PowerShell.

| Class/Enum/Method | Description |
| - | - |
| [SerialPort Class](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.io.ports.serialport) | Represents a serial port resource |
| [Parity Enum](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.io.ports.parity) | Specifies the parity bit for a SerialPort object |
| [StopBits Enum](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.io.ports.stopbits) | Specifies the number of stop bits used on the SerialPort object |
| [ReadExisting](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.io.ports.serialport.readexisting) | Specifies the number of stop bits used on the SerialPort object |
| [WriteLine](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.io.ports.serialport.writeline) | Specifies the number of stop bits used on the SerialPort object |

> **Note**: The System.IO.Ports.SerialPort class is also available in [.Net Core](https://www.nuget.org/packages/System.IO.Ports/) so you can also try to run this script on Linux or a Mac.

## Find available COM ports
After connecting you NDLR, you need to retrieve the available COM ports and find out on which port your NDLR is listening. You can use this PowerShell command:
```
[System.IO.Ports.SerialPort]::getportnames()
```
On my machine it returns COM 5:
![GetPortNames](images/getportnames.png)

## Serial options
To verify the serial port options, I used Cool Term to make sure.
</br>
1. In Cool Term press **Connect**
![CoolTerm_Connect](images/coolterm_connect.png)
1. When the NDLR is connected, select **options**
![CoolTerm_Connected](images/coolterm_connected.png)
1. Make note of the **Serial Port Options**
![CoolTerm_Options](images/coolterm_options.png)

Now you can specify or update the variables to use in your PowerShell Script:
```
$portName = "COM5"
$baudRate = 9600
$parity = [system.io.ports.parity]::None
$dataBits = 8
$stopBits = [system.io.ports.stopbits]::One
```
> **Note**: Make sure to use the [Parity Enum](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.io.ports.parity) and [StopBits Enum](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.io.ports.stopbits) Enums instead of a String.

## Open the Serial Port
Now that you now the needed ingredients, its time to open the Serial Port!
```
$port= new-Object System.IO.Ports.SerialPort $portName,$baudRate,$parity,$dataBits,$stopBits
```

Wait a second to make sure before opening...
```
Start-Sleep -Milliseconds 1000
```
And open the port:
```
$port.Open()
```
If have put that command with some logging to the console in a try catch block

# Write data
To send data to the NDLR, you can use the WriteLine() method:
```
$command = "text"
$port.WriteLine($command)
```

# Read data
To read data back from the NDLR after sending the command, you can use of course ReadLine(). However you can also use ReadExisting() to read all the data at once:
```
$port.ReadExisting()
```

# Examples
## Presets command - \<a\>
To Read a preset from **all** of The NDLR memory slots. The NDLR has 8 memory slots:
```
$command = "<a>"
$port.WriteLine($command)
```
Cool Term:
![coolterm_command_a](images/coolterm_commanda.png)

PowerShell:
![powershell_command_a](images/powershell_commanda.png)

## Presets command - \<a1\>
To Read a preset from The NDLR memory slot 1:
```
$command = "<a1>"
$port.WriteLine($command)
```
Cool Term:
![coolterm_command_a1](images/coolterm_commanda1.png)

PowerShell:
![powershell_command_a1](images/powershell_commanda1.png)

## NLDRUserSerial script
### Getting Started
Copy the script to a local directory, open the directory in PowerShell and start the script:
```
.\NDLRUSBSerial.ps1
```
### Main Menu
The menu starts with a small menu, disconnected:
![ndlr_usbserial_mainmenu](images/ndlr_usbserial_mainmenu.png)

### Connect to the NDLR
Use 0 connect to the NDLR. If you are already connected, you can always reconnect if something wrong occurs. Any open connection to the NDLR is closed before it tries to reconnect:
![ndlr_usbserial_connect](images/ndlr_usbserial_connect.png)
![ndlr_usbserial_connected](images/ndlr_usbserial_connected.png)
> **Note**: when you select 9 (disconnect) of x (exit) the connection will be closed. Don't use CTRL+C to end the script. The connection will remain open!

### Read Presets
Use 1 to toggle between the Presets options. You can read all the memory slots at once or just a single memory slot. Make sure to select the right slot number (1-8):
